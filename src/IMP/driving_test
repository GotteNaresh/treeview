I went to Hydershakote branch. This KPR driving school is the best one. My instructor was Raj Reddy. Raj Reddy has high level patience, understands the person very well and guides. He is too polite and answered every question of mine. Made me understand very well. He maintained perfect timings which suitable for me. Car condition also very good. Simulator helps you a lot. Hydershakote office is the best one and Raj Reddy is the best trainer.

If anyone wants to learn driving, I strongly recommend them to go to KPR driving school at Hydershakote.
